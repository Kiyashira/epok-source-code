      <h2>Ram raiding game</h2>
      <h3>
        There is a rumour going around that im working on ram raiding game. Well
        I am here to shut down this rumour as I am not currently working on one.
        I have no intention of ever doing one. In fact I strongly discourage
        anyone from supporting ram raiders and taking part in ram raids. This
        may harm you and hurt the target business quite a lot financially as the
        are just trying to make a living. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

        Remeber everthing is not perfect as this is only a hobby for me. I
        primarily focus on school and working on the linux kernel> I only do
        this in my spare time. So please stop hounding to make new games as I
        probably wont.

        Operating systems
      </h2>
      <h3>
        At Epok, we highly recommend using Linux over other operating systems such as Mac OS, Windows, and Chrome OS. Linux is an open-source operating system, which means that the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This allows for a more transparent and secure system as it can be easily audited by a community of developers.

One of the key advantages of using Linux is that it makes your computer run faster, with less space being used. Linux is known for its lightweight and efficient design, which allows it to run smoothly on older hardware, and it does not require as much resources to run as other operating systems. Furthermore, Linux is less vulnerable to viruses and malware, making it a safer choice for your computer.

Another important aspect to consider is the lack of government tracking and surveillance on Linux systems. Linux operating systems are not owned by any corporation and do not collect data on its users, giving you more privacy and security.

At Epok, we believe that Linux provides a superior user experience and is a more secure and reliable option for both personal and professional use. With its fast performance, efficient resource usage and lack of government tracking and viruses, Linux is the perfect choice for anyone looking to protect their data and ensure a smooth and secure computing experience.
     If you would like to know more about linux and what distro I reccomend you use come and talk to me or message
