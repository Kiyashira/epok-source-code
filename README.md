Dont use without reading the license.

This open source software to use it your project/Repo must be licensed with GPLV3 or any compatible licenses such as

GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL): The LGPL is a more permissive version of the GPL, primarily designed for libraries. It allows linking with non-GPL code, which makes it compatible with GPL-licensed projects.

Affero General Public License (AGPL): The AGPL is an extension of the GPL that specifically addresses network/server-side software. It requires users who interact with AGPL-licensed software over a network to share any modifications they make to the code, even if they don't distribute the software. The AGPL is considered compatible with the GPL, but the reverse is not true (GPL is not compatible with AGPL).

MIT License: The MIT License is a permissive, open-source license that allows code to be used, modified, and distributed under certain conditions. It is compatible with the GPL because it does not impose restrictions on other licenses.

Apache License 2.0: The Apache License 2.0 is another permissive license that allows the use, modification, and distribution of code under certain conditions. It is generally considered compatible with the GPL.
